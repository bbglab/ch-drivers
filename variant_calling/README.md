We called somatic variants using the 'reverse calling' approach in two differnt cohorts.

- The first one, the Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF), was run on the Google Cloud Computing Platform. (GCP) Instructions and code can be found within the hmf-calling-GCP folder. Please note you will need to get your project keys and launch the code in different Google Cloud instances. 

- The second one is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This require access to both the tumour bams and the germline bams (The script will download them). This was run in a HPC system. We provide the script to call one paired blood-tumour. Some external files are needed in order to run this script, please refer to the script to know how to download them.
